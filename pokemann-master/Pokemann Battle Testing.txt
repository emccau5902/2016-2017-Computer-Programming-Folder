
First steps...

a. Fix the bug in the run function so being faster helps you get away. (Switch the + & - if you haven't done so already.)
b. Run the program once and test an encounter with: g.encounter(pat, zoeotto). Run a few test encounters so that you can be sure you understand the events that make up encounters.
c. Test a battle with: g.battle(pat, jessie). Run a few test battles so that you can be sure you understand the events that make up battles.


To show...

1. Swap out Moves, Pokemann, Players, and NPCs with your own. Copy and paste your __main__ here.
lol, i didnt make any new pokemann, players, etc i just used place holders
2. Modify any output you feel would make game play more informative. What did you change? Don't post code, just describe where you modified output and why. i mostly changed the output to have less exclamations, to make it more neutral in tone, so it conincides more with the orginal games.

3. Test an encounter again. This time, demonstrate
	a. An instance where you faint the target
>>> g.battle(pat, jessie)
You found Jessie!
Jessie has the following Pokeman:
Coopasaur (health=100)
Mayfieldarow (health=90)
Katlevee (health=140)
Marcelax (health=30)

Your Coopasaur is ready.
Would you like to (f)ight or (s)witch out? f
